# This is a forked project from original author, i am really only updating this as it seemed like a dead project and had not been updated for newer game instances. 
## Requirements
- .NET Framework 4.0 or higher  https://www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?id=30653
- VC++ 2013 Redistributable  https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/download/details.aspx?id=40784

## Now for the things i have fixed or changed:
- cleaned up dependancies (removed need to go to 3.5.1)
- Fixed wheeled vehicle errors
- Fixed builtins files for event tanks
- Cleaned up a ton of code that now supports VS 2019

## Current atlas build height: 4096 x 5120

## What i want to add in the future:
I am trying to figure out a method to check for fonts existing on your system while building bulk saves, currently this program just auto builds any missing fonts with Arial and doesnt warn or post anything to user
