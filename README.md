This is a forked project from original author, i am really only updating this as it seemed like a dead project and had not been updated for newer game instances. 


Now for the things i have fixed or changed:

Updated dependancies: 
This now needs .Net Framework 3.5.1

Fixed wheeled vehicle errors
Fixed builtins files for event tanks
Cleaned up a ton of code that now supports VS 2019 








<u>What i want to add in the future:</u>

I am trying to figure out a method to check for fonts existing on your system while building bulk saves, currently this program just auto builds any missing fonts with Arial and doesnt warn or post anything to user
